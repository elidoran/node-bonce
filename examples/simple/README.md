An example of a Meteor package using a file generated by *bonce*.

Run this example:

```
git clone git@github.com:elidoran/node-bonce.git
cd node-bonce/examples/simple
npm install upper-case
bonce
```

Note:

1. I used `npm install upper-case' to install the module into a *node_modules* directory. This module will be included in the browserified file by default. Meteor's build tool ignores the *node_modules* directory.
2. There is no *entry file* for Browserify because *bonce* generates it.
3. There is no options file because all the defaults are good enough.
4. The generated file is *package.browserified.js* and is added to the package in its *package.js* file.
