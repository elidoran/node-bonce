An example of a Meteor package using a file generated by *bonce*.

Note:

1. I used `npm install upper-case reverse-string' to install the modules into a *node_modules* directory. These modules will be included in the browserified file because of the options file. Meteor's build tool ignores the *node_modules* directory.
2. There is no *entry file* for Browserify because *bonce* generates it based on the *includes* and *require* in the options file.
3. There is an options file specifying all the common options. Some are comments to show how to put them in the file.
4. The generated file is *package.browserified.js* and is added to the package in its *package.js* file.
