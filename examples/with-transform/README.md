An example of a Meteor package using a file generated by *bonce*.

Run this example:

```
git clone git@github.com:elidoran/node-bonce.git
cd node-bonce/examples/with-transform
npm install upper-case envify uglifyify
NODE_ENV=production bonce
```

Note:

1. I used `npm install upper-case envify uglifyify' to install the modules into a *node_modules* directory. Meteor's build tool ignores the *node_modules* directory.
2. The *upper-case* module will be included in the browserified file because of the `include` settings in the options file.
3. The *envify* and *uglifyify* modules are transforms and are not part of the resulting browserified file.
4. The *entry file* for Browserify is in the default location: `node_modules/browserify.js`. I made it, instead of letting it be generated, so I could add some code which is affected by the transforms.
5. There is an options file to specify the `include` and `transform` settings.
6. The generated file is *package.browserified.js* and is added to the package in its *package.js* file.
7. The output will vary depending on the value you set for *NODE_ENV*. Set it to *development* and the code snippet in *browserify.js* file will be included. Set it to something else and it will be stripped by uglifyify.
